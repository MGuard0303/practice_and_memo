# Introduction to comparison tool

The intention of this project is that I switch to safari from chrome, but the computer of my workplace is still Windows-based. Sometime I have to update the bookmark between
two browsers. The bookmark html file generated by chrome has a hierarchical structure, I think it's a good way to store this structure in a tree.

This tool can also be used to check whether there is change in a given directory (due to directory also has a hierarchical structure).
